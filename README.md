## 🌟 About Week-1 Project: Techplement
🚀 In my **Week-1 internship project**, I developed a **responsive online course-selling website** aimed at ensuring a smooth and intuitive user experience. This project emphasized adaptability across devices and ease of navigation for users 📱💻. While advanced features could have been implemented, the primary goal was to perfect responsiveness and usability. The experience gained during this project significantly contributed to the development approach of this Social Media Dashboard 🌐.

## 📌 Project Overview
